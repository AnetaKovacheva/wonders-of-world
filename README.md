# wonders-of-world

This Notebook explores transfer learning with `EfficientNetB3`. The latter is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network Architecture, proposaed in 2020 (see the link to an Arxiv paper in the Notebook). The experiment uses the Wornders of World dataset, available in Kaggle. Most of the code is taken from a Kaggle user (link to it is provided in the Notebook).
